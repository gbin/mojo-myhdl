# myhdl

It needs the requirements from requirements.txt + fix this problem on rhea : https://github.com/cfelton/rhea/issues/5

- compile.sh compiles and deploys on the mojo board
- mojo.py is a pure python implementation of the mojo-loader
- chenil.py is a little demo that needs a button on pin 51

Change the py directly to switch from bitstream compilation to simulation.
